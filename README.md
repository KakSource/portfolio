Added a lot of new things, modified lots of styles in different CSS (thanks god react is component based, with express would be torture)
Added 3 new WIP projects (Music Player, Meme Generator, Random Quotes)
Modified the name of Reflexion Generator to Random Reflections because not only it wasn't with 'X' but does not generate anything, it's not at AI, just a compilation of reflections in images randomized with a number generated with Math.random().
Modified the CSS of the Header to match the corresponding size and made the link buttons bigger.
